Sessions are only provisional until confirmed by their respective speaker(s). The actual schedule may also be rearranged, replaced or cancelled until the very last minute depending on speakers availability.<br/><br/>Curious about how the schedule came to be?

The second day will be decided on the moment and will take the form of an
Open-Space. We did receive <strong>many</strong> applications for speakers, and we believe
that a lot are also perfectly suitable for this format. So we invite speakers
that didn't get the opportunity on the first day to come again during the
Open-Space!
