          Hands-on! We'll start the day with a big <a class="text-primary-400 dark:text-primary-50" target="_blank" href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/open-space/">Open Space</a> and co-create the track for the day.<br/><br/>
          Feel like hacking on something for a day?<br/><br/>
          Or perhaps, contributing to some open-source project(s) of the ecosystem?<br/><br/>
          This will be ours to decide and to collectively design the day. Three working spaces will be available to let the magic happen. Make sure to bring your gears.
